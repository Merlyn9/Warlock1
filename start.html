    <h2>
       <p> If you are just starting your journey in tech, you must be made aware of these.<br>
        There are some amazing tools out there. That are free, that you can access if<br>
        you know what to look for.  There are a few common programs one would benefit<br>
        from starting with.  These programs are presented here in a way, that anybody,<br>
         any skill level might learn by them and understand at a practical level.</p>
         <br>
         <p>Libre Office is an open-source software.  Open-sourced meaning the community keeps up the code<br>
          and for the most part, is free to use.  Libre Office is very easy to install, just type the following <br>
          into your terminal.<br>
          $ sudo apt install libreoffice

         </p>
         <p>             Skills as a developer are in high demand.  This world is developing fast and
              we must<br> meet the challenge.  We must answer the call.  We could start by learning
              the basics and foundational<br>  skills needed to grow with. Before you start your
               journey it helps if you know Linux.  If you haven't met Linux I encourage you to seek
               out Jammin Jellyfish.  Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is the most current version. Follow this link 
               <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop">Ubuntu 22.04 LTS</a>
         </p> 
        <br>
        <p>
            Also a fun fact is that security in tech is also a big thing  So if security is your<br>
            jam you should try out Kali Linux.  It has a pentesting suite loaded and ready to go<br>
            upon initial installation.  Here is the link. <a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-live">
                Kali Linux</a>
        </p>
         <p>Before you reset your computer to Linux, it would be wise to collect all your data onto <br>
            an external hardrive.  So you can have it when you refresh your OS.  If you are a fan of 
            making good money you should learn to love Linux.  Anyway get all you stuff onto a drive then 
            you can have everything to transfer over.  Also Linux has to be updated by you.  You can micro 
            manage updates or update everything all at once. But you must update everyday it helps keep things 
            running smoothly.  It is different from Windows in that Windows does this automatically. 
         </p>
        </h2>              
         <br><h1>Kanban</h1>
                  <h3>A kanban board is a japanese method of keeping on task and to track the progress of work.<br>
                 It is very effective and is used by some of the worlds most successful people.  If they use it,<br>
                  maybe we can take a deeper look into the Kanban. It sure has helped me out along the way. </h3>
                  <br>
                  <h1>Virtual Box</h1>
                <h3> <p>Another alternative when you can't live without your Windows, is a VirtualBox.  <br>
            A virtual Box or a vagrant box is a seperate computer inside a sandbox on your desktop.
            You can load this box with Ubuntu or Kali Linux and commence your jammin.  It use your hardware space
            but is dynamically allocated if you so choose.  So it uses what your not using when it gets up and running.
        </h3> 
         </p>
         <br>
         <p><h1>Visual Studio Code</h1>
            <h3> Another tool a developer needs is the text editor.  I recommend Visual Studio Code, it has<br>
                the ability to harness extensions. Also it is the favorite to most developers.  With a text editor <br>
                you can many different types of files with various computer languages to boot.<br>
                 If you have Ubuntu, you can download it from the applications store.  This text editor has the ability<br>
                 to have extensions,  and it make all the difference in the world.  Start off with Visual Studio Code and <br>
               learn all the file types. Learn how to know what directory you are currently in.

                   <p><h1>NodeJS</h1>
                    <h3>
                    NodeJS is a JavaScript Runtime that lets you write code, then run that code.<br>
                    You also can write applications for client-side servers and run them.<br>
                    With nodemon you can run an app in a development environment while<br>
                     updating the code and see immediate changes while viewing the app.<br>
                    This JavaScript program will help the way you see and understand the back end.</p></h3>

                    <p><h1>Python 3</h1><h3>
                       Python3 is a beast of a programming language.  So big it <br>
                       is revolutionizing how we interact with data.  It is shaping the <br>
                    future of technology.  It allows us to automate tasks snd processes.<br>
                    Python comes with many libraries for many different goals in mind.<br>
                    Python is a valuable tool and training to learn this tool is free.

    <p>Downloading these programs will allow you to create a basic developers environment. <br>
      From which you could easily scale into cloud, cybersecurity, or web design<br>
    It might be more simple to start with Linux.  My 2 preferred distros are Ubuntu, and Kali Linux.<br>
    If you have never worked with Linux before, you should try it.  Its actually more interesting than plain jane Windows.<br>
    Also if you learn how to "Linux", it is a skill that is on the job market.  So a win win all around.<br>
