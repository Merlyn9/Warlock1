I am also working on a portfolio and a couple of websites. I have a menu site for my bodega, a gallery site for an artist friend of mine and a portfolio site for me and all my services.
To share my interests and tell my story. I also am getting together a toolkit for breaking into the industry.

I have been a magician most my life.  Now I have turned to the magic of web development. 
Wow, what a awesome adventure.
